Description:
   This command can get or set the host name or the NIS domain name. You can
   also get the DNS domain or the FQDN (fully qualified domain name).
   Unless you are using bind or NIS for host lookups you can change the
   FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) and the DNS domain name (which is
   part of the FQDN) in the /etc/hosts file.
